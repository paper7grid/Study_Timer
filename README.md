Hello!! 

StudyBloom, a calming Pomodoro timer app to help students stay focused and productive!
Pomodoro technique is a technique used while studying to maximize efficiency. 
It uses the Pomodoro technique which is 25 minutes of focused study followed by 5–10 minute breaks. It tracks your completed sessions, also has a peaceful background, and includes motivational quote!It also records sessions after you finish. 
Make sure Python is installed before you run it, and have fun studying!
Why I made this? As a student, staying focused on studying or other activity is hard, especially when (like me) you get distracted easily. I wanted to build something that felt comforting and calm. So I made **StudyBloom** something I'd actually enjoy using while studying or working on projects.

How I built it: I used python to code this project. I also used libraries like customtinker for the modern UI, Pillow to import the background image and Time and threading for the countdown feature. 
I originally tried to package the app so anyone could just download and open it — but ran into issues with file paths. I learned, then I had an idea of turning it into a ZIP file so anyone can access it with Python. I learned how to use customtinker especially in this project.
