Hello!! 
StudyBloom, a calming Pomodoro timer app to help students stay focused and productive!
Pomodoro technique is a technique used while studying to maximize efficiency. 
It uses the Pomodoro technique which is 25 minutes of focused study followed by 5â€“10 minute breaks. It tracks your completed sessions, also has a peaceful background, and includes motivational quote!
I coded it using python and used libraries such as Customtinker, time, and threading. It also records sessions after everyone you finish. 
Make sure Python is installed before you run it, and have fun studying!
